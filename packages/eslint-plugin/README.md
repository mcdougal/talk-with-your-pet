Custom ESLint rules.

Because our rules are written in TypeScript, you must build the source code before it can take effect:

```sh
npm run build
```

We use the [`@typescript-eslint/utils`](https://typescript-eslint.io/docs/development/custom-rules/#rulecreator) for defining custom rules in TypeScript.
