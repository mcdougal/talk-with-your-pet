        // So this one is a little hard to justify, but we're doing it anyways.
        // While we strongly believe in using blank lines to separate logical
        // blocks of code, JSX is different because it directly translates into
        // something visual. As a developer, you mentally translate the code
        // into a visual representation of the code. Blank lines do two things
        // to hinder that mental translation:
        //
        // 1. They add something visual to the code that is ignored in the final
        //    display, adding some cognitive overhead when reading the code and
        //    visualizing the output in your head.
        // 2. They encourage more complexity in the JSX. It is already hard to
        //    look at JSX and see the visual output in your head. If you have
        //    large blocks with things like complex conditionals, long callback
        //    functions and inline styles, then it can be difficult to skim the
        //    JSX and understand what is going on visually.
        //
        // Per the second point, instead of adding blank lines between large
        // JSX blocks, it is recommended to find ways to make the JSX block
        // smaller. For example, complex conditionals can be abstracted into
        // variables, callback props can be lifted out of the JSX or put in
        // their own file, and inline styles can be moved to a CSS file.
        //
        // One of the best strategies of all is to simply push a bunch of JSX
        // (and the corresponding styles) into its own component. For example,
        // imagine a component that renders a form. The JSX section of the
        // component could get quite long, but you can avoid this by creating
        // small components so that the top level component's JSX is much
        // easier to read. Here's what that might look like:
        //
        // ```tsx
        // <MyForm onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        //   <MyFormHeader />
        //   <MyFormContent>
        //     <NameField onChange={setName} value={name} />
        //     <EmailField onChange={setEmail} value={email} />
        //     <LocationAutocomplete onChange={setLocation} value={location} />
        //   </MyFormContent>
        //   <MyFormActions onCancel={handleCancel} />
        // </MyForm>
        // ```
        //
        // By making new components, it is much easier to read the JSX for the
        // form and understand the structure and behavior of the UI without
        // getting bogged down by a bunch of details that you might not care
        // about at this level. All of the text field overrides and custom
        // field styles are contained within the sub-components, so you can
        // focus on just what the parent component is doing.
        //
        // With this strategy, extra blank lines between JSX elements is no
        // longer necessary.
        //
        // The final point to make is that we can always relax this rule in the
        // future, but if we start without this rule enabled and decide that
        // we want it later then it is much more work because we would have to
